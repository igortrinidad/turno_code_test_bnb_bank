# Turno code test BNB  Bank

### Getting started - Welcome to my BNB Bank

This application shows a small portion of my habilities to create modern web applications using Vue3 (Nuxt.js) and Laravel.

### /frontend
Inside this directory lies a conventional Nuxt.js (Vue3) application, showcasing the frontend aspect of the project. All designs are custom made components using TailwindCSS.

### /server
Contained within this folder is a freshly minted Laravel 11x application. I've meticulously restructured the folder layout to adhere to the Domain-Driven Design (DDD) pattern. Navigate through the 'modules' folder to discover tailored resources catering to distinct user types and functionalities.

### /docker
If you're like me and prefer to run backend resources (databases, api's and so on) on Docker, this folder has everything you gonna need to startup your application as quickly as possible for your development environemnt.

To the application work fully properly, you need to provide an AWS S3 bucket info:

``` SHELL
#.env
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=
AWS_DEFAULT_REGION="us-east-1"
AWS_BUCKET=
```

In order to the frontend upload works, you need to define the CORS settings on your AWS S3 bucket:

```json
[
    {
        "AllowedHeaders": [
            "Authorization",
            "Content-Range",
            "Accept",
            "Content-Type",
            "Origin",
            "Range"
        ],
        "AllowedMethods": [
            "GET",
            "HEAD",
            "POST",
            "PUT"
        ],
        "AllowedOrigins": [
            "*"
        ],
        "ExposeHeaders": [
            "Content-Length",
            "Access-Control-Allow-Origin",
            "Content-Type",
            "Access-Control-Expose-Headers",
            "ETag"
        ],
        "MaxAgeSeconds": 3000
    }
]
```
